#An example of a legacy project that requires dependancy breaking to allow tests to be introduced, values to be sensed and changes to be made.

## Issues
1. Hidden Dependancies
2. Hard to Understand Code
3. Asyncronous Calls
4. System Dependancies
4. Singleton Patterns

## Techniques
1. Dependancy Injection
2. Method Extraction
3. Subclass and Override
4. Introduce Static Setter
5. Sketch Effects

## Example Excercise
1. Bring the Music Analytics class under test
2. Remove the system dependancy on <MediaPlayer.framework>
